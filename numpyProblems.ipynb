        "NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. As the backbone of many data science and machine learning workflows, a solid understanding of NumPy is essential for anyone working with numerical data in Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "Creating NumPy Arrays:\n",
        "\n",
        "Arrays can be created using the numpy.array() function, passing a sequence-like object (e.g., a list or tuple).\n",
        "NumPy also offers functions like numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones(), and numpy.arange() for array creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes of NumPy Arrays:\n",
        "Shape: Describes the size of each dimension of the array.\n",
