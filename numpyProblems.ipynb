        "NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. As the backbone of many data science and machine learning workflows, a solid understanding of NumPy is essential for anyone working with numerical data in Python.\n",
